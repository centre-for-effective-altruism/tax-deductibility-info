In Canada, you can receive tax credits for your donations at the federal and provincial level. Use this handy calculator (sam how do I format links?) http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/dnrs/svngs/clmng1b2-eng.html to figure out how much you can claim. The money that can be claimed from a tax deductible donation will enable you to be more generous than you initially thought.
