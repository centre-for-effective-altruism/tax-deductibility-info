In the US, your donations are deducted from your taxable income (up to a maximum of 50% of your adjusted gross income). Use this handy tool https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=40#.VfHLB_lVhBc to calculate your tax savings. The money that can be claimed from a tax deductible donation will enable you to be more generous than you initially thought.
